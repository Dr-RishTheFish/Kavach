"""advise: conversational answers to questions about the person's dealings with others
("my nephew wants gift cards, should I?", "a man from my bank says my account is locked, what do I do?").

Grounded the same way as scam_check: the community search (7a) and the red-flag floor set a minimum
verdict the model can't lower. MODEL_WRITER writes the answer with the last few messages of this
conversation in context, so follow-up questions work. The check is stored with save_message_check
(so it appears in the app and feeds the corpus when risky) and the reply goes out through the outbox.

Tool calls (max 6): get_person, search_community, read inbound history, read outbox history,
save_message_check, enqueue_outbox.
