# Setting up Kavach on a new Mac

This gets the full stack running locally: SpacetimeDB, the agent service (Nemotron via NVIDIA NIM), the
iMessage/SMS worker (console mode first, then the real Photon iMessage line), and the iPhone app.
It takes about 20 minutes, most of it installs.

Versions this was built and tested with are in brackets.

## 1. Install the tools

You need macOS on Apple silicon with **Xcode 26** [26.4.1] from the App Store. Open Xcode once to accept
the license and install the iOS 26 Simulator (Xcode → Settings → Components).

```sh
# Homebrew (skip if you have it): https://brew.sh
brew install uv xcodegen git            # uv [0.13], xcodegen [2.46]

# Node 22 [22.13] via nvm (or any Node 20+)
brew install nvm && mkdir -p ~/.nvm
# follow the two lines nvm prints for your shell profile, open a new terminal, then:
nvm install 22

# SpacetimeDB CLI + local server [2.14.1]
curl -sSf https://install.spacetimedb.com | sh
# open a new terminal, then pin the version the module was built against:
spacetime version install 2.14.1 && spacetime version use 2.14.1
spacetime --version
```

`uv` downloads Python 3.12 for the Python services by itself; you don't need to install Python.

## 2. Clone and configure

```sh
git clone <your-repo-url> kavach && cd kavach
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set these (everything else can stay as is):

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `SERVICE_CLAIM_KEY` | any random string, e.g. output of `openssl rand -hex 24` |
| `AGENT_SERVICE_TOKEN` | another random string, e.g. `openssl rand -hex 24` |
| `NIM_API_KEY` | an NVIDIA API key (`nvapi-...`) from [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com). Optional: without it every workflow uses rule-based fallbacks |
| `PHOTON_PROJECT_ID`, `PHOTON_API_KEY` | only for the real iMessage line (step 6): the Spectrum project id and project secret from [app.photon.codes](https://app.photon.codes). Leave `MESSAGING_GATEWAY=console` until then |

The model ids in `.env.example` (`MODEL_FAST`, `MODEL_WRITER`, `MODEL_EMBED`, `MODEL_VISION`) were
checked against one NVIDIA account. Model availability differs per account, so check yours:

```sh
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $NIM_API_KEY" https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1/models \
  | python3 -c "import json,sys; [print(m['id']) for m in json.load(sys.stdin)['data'] if 'nemotron' in m['id']]"
```

Never commit `.env` or `.spacetime-tokens.json`; both are in `.gitignore`.

## 3. Install dependencies

```sh
npm install                                   # root scripts (seed, tokens, smoke)
(cd spacetime && npm install)                 # SpacetimeDB module
(cd photon-worker && npm install)             # iMessage/SMS worker
(cd agents && uv sync)                        # agent service (NeMo Agent Toolkit, Guardrails)
```

## 4. Start SpacetimeDB and load the demo data

In a **separate terminal**, leave this running:

```sh
spacetime start
```

Then, from the repo root:

```sh
npm run publish:local:clean   # publish the module as database `kavach`
npm run tokens                # one SpacetimeDB identity per service -> .spacetime-tokens.json
npm run smoke                 # expect "All checks passed" (58 checks); run it while the services are stopped
npm run demo:reset            # load shared/seed/demo.json (Joe, Tommy, Maria, campaigns, reports)
```

Pick the demo data you want:

| Command | Loads |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run demo:reset` | `shared/seed/demo.json`: demo people Joe, Tommy and Maria with family links, campaigns and reports. Keeps existing app sign-ins. |
| `npm run demo:scam-calls` | `shared/seed/scam_calls.json`: **erases all users and scam data**, then loads 8 phone-scam campaigns, 11 scam caller numbers (the top one is +1 346-481-9285 with 75 reports) and call scripts. No users: sign in from the app. |
| `npm run dev:wipe` | Like `demo:reset`, but also removes app sign-ins so numbers can be registered again. |

`npm run smoke` wipes and re-seeds the database, so reload the demo data you want afterwards.

## 5. Start the services

```sh
npm run start:local
```

This starts the agent service on `:8088` and the iMessage worker on `:8090` (console or Photon, from
`MESSAGING_GATEWAY` in `.env`), logging to `.run/agents.log` and `.run/photon.log`. Stop them with
`npm run stop:local`.

Check that everything is up:

```sh
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3000/v1/ping && echo spacetimedb ok
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8088/health/details   # agent: engine, guardrails, llm, task_poller
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8090/health           # worker: gateway, last poll, sent/failed
```

In console mode, text the agent as any number and see its replies:

```sh
scripts/text.sh +15555550101 "TxTag: unpaid toll \$6.80, pay now https://txtag-pay.top/inv/1"
scripts/text.sh +15555550101 "verify Tommy"
scripts/text.sh +15555550102 "not me"          # Tommy answers the verification
```

Demo people (from `demo:reset`): **Joe** `+15555550101` (protected person), **Tommy** `+15555550102`
(grandson, iMessage, emergency contact), **Maria** `+15555550103` (daughter, SMS). Family code word:
"blue pancake".

Things to try by text: forward a message (start it with `Forwarded message:` and optionally a
`From: <number>` line), ask a question ("my nephew wants gift cards, should I?"), `report +1 346 481 9285`,
`add Maria 214-555-0100 daughter`, `who is in my family`, `status`, `verify Tommy`, `pause` / `resume`,
`wrong` (feedback on the last answer), `help`.

### The real iMessage line (Photon)

1. In `.env` set `MESSAGING_GATEWAY=photon`, `PHOTON_PROJECT_ID` and `PHOTON_API_KEY` (the project secret).
2. `npm run stop:local && npm run start:local`. `.run/photon.log` should show `photon.started`.
3. Text the project's number from any iPhone. On Photon's shared line the number is shown in the Photon
   dashboard (ours is +1 415-610-6180). Replies come back in the same thread.

Only one worker should run against a Photon project at a time: if a teammate's worker is connected,
messages may go to theirs. Group threads for family alerts need a dedicated Photon line.

## 6. Run the iPhone app

```sh
cd ios && xcodegen generate && open Kavach.xcodeproj
```

In Xcode pick the **Kavach** scheme and an **iPhone 17** simulator, then press **⌘R**. No signing is
needed for the Simulator. In the app, sign in as **Joe** with **+15555550101**, tap **Text me a code**
and enter **000000** to see the demo data. (Demo numbers +1 555-555-xxxx accept `000000` while
`DEMO_MODE=true`; any other number gets a real 6-digit code by text through the Photon worker.)

Signing in on a second phone moves the number there; **Settings → Sign out of this phone** releases it.

Ways to feed the app a "message" (the app can't read real SMS; see the spec's platform constraints):
- `scripts/text.sh +15555550101 "..."`: the check then shows in the app under **This week**.
- `echo "some text" | xcrun simctl pbcopy booted`, then tap **Paste** on Check a message.
- Share text from Notes in the Simulator to **Kavach** (Share extension).
- Test a push banner:
  ```sh
  printf '{"Simulator Target Bundle":"com.hack.kavach.app","aps":{"alert":{"title":"Kavach","body":"Tommy says it was NOT them. This is a scam."}}}' > /tmp/kavach.apns
  xcrun simctl push booted com.hack.kavach.app /tmp/kavach.apns
  ```
  The banner shows only after the app has been allowed to send notifications (tap **Allow** when it asks).

## 7. Run the tests

| Component | Command |
| --- | --- |
| SpacetimeDB module | `npm run smoke` |
| agents (unit) | `cd agents && uv run pytest -m "not integration"` |
| agents (integration) | see `agents/README.md` (uses its own database, `kavach-agents`) |
| photon-worker | `cd photon-worker && npm test` |
| iOS | `cd ios && xcodebuild test -scheme Kavach -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17' CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO` |

## Running on a real iPhone

See `ios/README.md` for details. Put your settings in `ios/Config/Local.xcconfig` (gitignored), not in
Xcode, because `xcodegen generate` rewrites the project:

```
DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = <your Apple team id>
SPACETIME_URL = https:/$()/<spacetimedb address>
AGENT_SERVICE_URL = https:/$()/<agent service address>
```

The bundle ids are `com.hack.kavach.app` (+ `.CallDirectory`, `.Report`, `.Share`, `.MessageFilter`). If
your team can't use them, change the prefix everywhere in `ios/` (project.yml, entitlements, App Group in
`Config/Kavach.xcconfig`, `AppModel.swift`, `SharedStore.swift`, `AppConfig.swift`) and `APNS_TOPIC` in
`.env`; extension ids must start with the app's id.

**Reaching the backend from the phone.** `127.0.0.1` on a phone is the phone itself. Two options:

- **Tunnels (works on any network, recommended):** `brew install cloudflared`, then
  `cloudflared tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:3000` and `cloudflared tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:8088`
  in two terminals. Use the two `https://….trycloudflare.com` addresses they print as `SPACETIME_URL` and
  `AGENT_SERVICE_URL`. The addresses change every time the tunnels restart, and anyone with them can
  reach your dev backend while they run.
  Quick tunnels also expire on their own (the log says `Tunnel not found` and the app can't connect):
  restart them, put the new addresses in `Local.xcconfig`, and rebuild the app, because the addresses are
  built in (including the Recents report endpoint).
- **Same Wi-Fi:** start SpacetimeDB with `spacetime start --listen-addr 0.0.0.0:3000` and use
  `http:/$()/<Mac IP>:3000` / `:8088` (`ipconfig getifaddr en0`). Fails on hotspots and on campus or venue
  Wi-Fi that blocks device-to-device traffic.

**Push notifications** need an APNs key (paid Apple Developer account): set `APNS_KEY_ID`,
`APNS_TEAM_ID` and `APNS_KEY_P8` (path to the `.p8` file) in `.env`, then restart the services. Xcode
builds use Apple's sandbox push server, which is the default.

Caller labels, the Recents report extension, the Action Button and push notifications only work on a
device.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `SpacetimeDB is not running` | Run `spacetime start` in another terminal. |
| `no token for admin; run "npm run tokens"` | Run `npm run tokens` (after every `publish:local:clean`). |
| `register_person is retired` | The app build is older than the module: rebuild the iOS app (sign-in is now `request_sign_in` + `verify_sign_in`). |
| `000000` is not accepted | Only for +1 555-555-xxxx numbers, and only with `DEMO_MODE=true` in `.env` when publishing. |
| `too many codes requested` / `too many attempts` | Wait (1 h / 10 min) or `npm run demo:reset`, which clears pending sign-ins. |
| Replies are generic / say they couldn't check | `NIM_API_KEY` missing, or a model id isn't enabled for your account (see step 2). Check `.run/agents.log`. |
| `Address already in use` on 8088/8090 | `npm run stop:local`, then start again. |
| Publish fails with a schema error | `npm run publish:local:clean` (drops local data), then `npm run tokens && npm run demo:reset`. |
| App shows no data | Make sure you signed in as `+15555550101` and `npm run start:local` is running. |
| iPhone app can't connect ("Could not connect" / timeouts) | Tunnels expired or the Mac changed networks: restart the tunnels, update `ios/Config/Local.xcconfig`, rebuild. |
| No reply in iMessage | `curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8090/health` should show `"gateway":"photon"`; check `.run/photon.log`, and that no other worker is connected to the same Photon project. |
| `number already registered` when signing up | Sign in again with the code flow, or `npm run dev:wipe` to clear all sign-ins. |
| Builds fail with "No space left on device" | Free disk space (Xcode simulators and DerivedData are the usual culprits). |
